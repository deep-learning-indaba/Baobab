# Frequently Asked Questions

**I have never worked on a large scale project like this before. Should I jump right in, or how much code should I look at first?**

This depends on you. The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to worry about breaking anything. All code is reviewed and tested before being deployed so jumping right in or taking a slower and more measured approach are both fine. The issue descriptions should also contain enough information to get you started and if not, a comment asking for clarification is more than welcome.

**What are the expected time frames regarding the high and low priority?**

High priority: pull request within two days.

Low priority: pull request after seven to nine days.

**I can’t help right now, but I should free up in a month or two - can I still help?**

Baobab will log a continuous stream of new issues, bugs that creep in, or new features needed. Keep checking on the repository once you have capacity to start or continue contributing on a regular basis.

**I am struggling to install docker**

This sometimes happens when using old versions of Mac, or Windows Home Edition. A possible solution is to install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/).

**My country doesn’t allow for docker to installed**

[Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/) is a free VPN that doesn’t require a credit card for set up and can potentially help with the install. Tor browsers are also a potential avenue to try out. If you find a workaround that works, please let us know!

**How much disk space is required to run the project?**

The docker images, containers, and volumes use up approximately 4.7GB of disk space.

**I have a question about the issue, where should I ask?**

All questions relating to a specific issue, should be left on the GitHub on the issue itself (or the Pull Request if you've opened one).

Please be as descriptive as possible, and include any error messages you might be experiencing.

If you have any time, please peruse the other issues and see if there are other questions you can answer. We are here to learn from each other!
