## Project Structure
- src
  - images
  - pages
    - components
  - services


## Adding Code
Add a new folder for each component/page. Name the folder according to the item/feature you are building. Do not include the item type in the name. Example: `Home` **not** `HomePage`.

In each item folder, create a `[item].js`, `[item].css` and `__tests__/[item].test.js`. Also create a  `components` folder where you will be break up parts of a page into re-usable components. A page should just be a collection of components, with each component (as far as possible) handling its own logic.

When wanting to call a service, create a folder in the `services` folder with the name of the service and `[service].js` that handles the service calls. 

## Adding Tests
We are using Jest + Enzyme as a testing framework. Read this [article](https://hackernoon.com/testing-react-components-with-jest-and-enzyme-41d592c174f), which explains how to use jest and enzyme. Note we are not doing snapshot testing - simply testing rendering, props and events.

Example
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {shallow} from 'enzyme';
import Home from '../Home.js';

test('Check if Home component renders.', () => {
  // Render Home main component.
  const wrapper = shallow(<Home />);
  expect(wrapper.length).toEqual(1);
});
```
## Styling
We use [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/) as a CSS framework.
