Our duty, as we come together at the Indaba, is to create a familyhood of people and cultures and learning, built on the principles of freedom, equality and unity; and towards the aim of strengthening African machine learning. 

This means that every participant is responsible for providing a safe experience for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion, or socioeconomic status. As organisers, we are committed to these responsibilities and will not tolerate harassment of Indaba participants in any form.

Every participant of the Indaba must fiercely defend these principles, and make it their responsibility to uphold the spirit of togetherness. 

If a participant engages in behaviour that breaks this code of conduct, the organisers retain the right to take any actions needed to keep the Indaba a welcoming environment for all participants. You can report a concern or an incident through an anonymous report, or in person.

For details of expected conduct, unacceptable behaviour, how to report an incident, how we maintain a respectful community, and how we enforce these standards, please go to deeplearningindaba.com/conduct or send a message to conduct@deeplearningindaba.com.""",
